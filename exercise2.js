// Exercise 2: Create a Prototype with Chaining and Inheritance
// Instructions: 
// 1. Create a constructor function called "Device" with a "brand" property and a method "powerOn" that logs "[brand] device is now powered on."
// 2. Create another constructor function called "Smartphone" that inherits from Device, and add a "model" property to Smartphone.
// 3. Add a method "call" to Smartphone's prototype that logs "Calling from [brand] [model]..."



// YOUR CODE HERE
function Device(brand){
  this._brand = brand
}


function Smartphone(brand, model){
  Device.call(this, brand)
  this._model = model
}

Device.prototype.powerOn = function(){
  console.log(`${this._brand} device is now powered on.`)
}

Smartphone.prototype = Object.create(Device.prototype)
Smartphone.prototype.construnctor = Smartphone


Smartphone.prototype.call = function(){
  console.log(`Calling from ${this._brand} ${this._model}.`)
}

// Test the Smartphone prototype with inheritance
const myPhone = new Smartphone("Apple", "iPhone 14");
myPhone.powerOn();  // Output: Apple device is now powered on. (inherited from Device)
myPhone.call();     // Output: Calling from Apple iPhone 14. (defined in Smartphone)
